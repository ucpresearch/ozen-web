# Ozen-web

**Browser-based acoustic analysis and annotation**

A powerful, browser-based tool for phonetic research, built with
Svelte and WebAssembly. Analyze pitch, formants, intensity, and more,
with various supporting backends.

## Key Features

::: {.feature-grid}
::: {.feature-card}
### <span class="feature-icon">📊</span> Phonetic Analysis

Powered by
[**praatfan_rust**](https://github.com/ucpresearch/praatfan-core-clean)
WebAssembly to provide acoustic measurements: pitch (F0), formants
(F1-F4), intensity, HNR, center of gravity, spectral tilt, and
more. 

```{=nothere}
* [**praatfan_rust**](https://github.com/ucpresearch/praatfan-core-clean)
  is a clean-room re-implementation of
  [Parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth) in Rust,
  so it can be distributed under MIT license. It does not yield
  perfect Praat-compatible values (e.g. different formants in
  voiceless areas). Praatfan_rust can also be packaged with Ozen-web. 

* [**praatfan_gpl**](https://github.com/ucpresearch/praatfan-core-rs)
  a re-implementation of
  [Parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth) in Rust,
  but paying close attention to implementation details as seen in the
  code, which leads to high compatibility with Parselmouth (which
  uses Praat's engine to calculate values). Use it if you want to get
  Praat-compatible measurements. The one downside is that it's
  GPL-license.

### Interactive Annotation

Full TextGrid support with multi-tier annotations. Add boundaries,
edit labels, snap to higher layer boundaries, with keyboard shortcuts
for efficient workflow.
:::

::: {.feature-card}
###  Mobile-Optimized

An alternative touch-friendly viewer-only front end with
pinch-to-zoom, drag-to-select, and responsive layout. Aimed for
phone-based access to phonetic analysis and embedding in
presentations.

:::

::: {.feature-card}
###  Works Offline

Runs entirely in a browser. No external server required, no data
uploaded.

:::

::: {.feature-card}
###  Data Collection

Double-click to add points of intest for data collection with acoustic
measurements. Export to TSV with all values and annotation labels for
statistical analysis, or ctrl-C / command-C to copy to clipboard.

:::

::: {.feature-card}
###  Highly Embeddable

Embed the viewer in Quarto documents, R Markdown, Jupyter notebooks,
or any web page. URL parameters for pre-configuration and data URL
support for self-contained embeds.

## Quick Start

* Use the [live version](live/index.html)

* Or download the `docs/live/` directory to directory on your server, `live/`

	**Important**: Ozen-web will not work if you just open a local
    html file in your browser, it has to be served from a web
    server. The web server can be local though (python has `python -m
    http.server`). If this sounds complicated, [try the python
    interface](https://github.com/ucpresearch/ozen)


```{=nothere}
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ucpresearch/ozen-web.git
cd ozen-web

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy WASM package (if using local backend)
mkdir -p static/wasm/praatfan
cp -r ../praatfan-core-clean/rust/pkg/* static/wasm/praatfan/

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

See the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.html) for detailed installation instructions.

## Live Demo

Try the interactive viewer below. This example shows a spectrogram with pitch and formant overlays:

::: {.viewer-embed}
<iframe src="https://ucpresearch.github.io/ozen-web/viewer?overlays=pitch,formants" title="ozen-web Interactive Demo"></iframe>
:::

::: {.callout-note}
The embedded viewer requires audio to be loaded. Click "Load Audio", record yourself, or drag a WAV file to explore features.

## Use Cases

**Phonetics Research**
: Measure vowel formants, analyze intonation contours, annotate phonetic transcription

**Speech Pathology**
: Visualize voice quality measures (HNR, spectral tilt), track therapy progress

**Language Documentation**
: Transcribe endangered languages, create time-aligned corpora, work offline in the field with laptop or tablet.

**Teaching & Presentations**
: Embed interactive spectrograms in lecture slides, Quarto documents, or course websites. Students can explore audio without installing software.

**Podcast & Audio Production**
: Visualize speech clarity, identify noise regions, mark edit points with sub-second accuracy.

## Browser Compatibility

Should work on most modern web browsers
