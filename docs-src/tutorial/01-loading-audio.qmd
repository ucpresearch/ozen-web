## Overview

In this section, you'll learn how to load audio files into Ozen-web using three different methods:

1. **Drag and drop** (fastest)
2. **File picker** (traditional)
3. **Microphone recording** (create new audio)

## Before You Start

Make sure Ozen-web is running in your browser:

- [**Hosted version**](live/index.html)
- **Local server**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (change the port to number to match your server)

You should see an empty interface with a prominent file drop zone.

## Method 1: Drag and Drop

The fastest way to load audio is drag-and-drop:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Find an audio file** on your computer (WAV, MP3, or OGG format)

2. **Drag the file** over the Ozen-web window

   The drop zone will highlight with a blue border

   ![Drag-drop highlighted](../screenshots/tutorial-01-drag-drop.png){.screenshot}

3. **Release the mouse** button

4. **Wait for loading** (1-2 seconds)

   - Progress indicator appears briefly
   - Waveform appears in the display
   - Spectrogram loads (or prompts to zoom for long files)

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
You can drag files from Finder (Mac), File Explorer (Windows), or Nautilus/Dolphin (Linux).
:::

## Method 2: File Picker

If you prefer a traditional file dialog:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Click the "Load Audio" button** in the interface (usually top-left or center)

2. **Select your audio file** in the file dialog

3. **Click "Open"**

4. Audio loads just like drag-and-drop
:::

::: {.callout-note}
The file picker shows only supported formats (WAV, FLAC, MP3, OGG). If
your file doesn't appear, check the format or try "All Files" filter.
:::

## Method 3: Microphone Recording

Create new audio directly in the browser:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Click the microphone icon** 🎤 (usually in the toolbar)

2. **Allow microphone access** when prompted by the browser

   ![Browser microphone permission dialog](../screenshots/microphone-permission.png){.screenshot}

3. **Click the red record button**

4. **Speak into your microphone**

   - A timer shows recording duration
   - Maximum recording time: 60 seconds (configurable)

5. **Click the stop button** when finished

6. **The recorded audio loads automatically**
:::

::: {.callout-try}
Try recording yourself saying a few words that differ only by their vowels (_bead_, _bid_, _bed_, _bad_) to see clear formant patterns in the spectrogram.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Microphone recording uses your browser's MediaRecorder API. Quality depends on your microphone and browser settings. For research-grade recordings, use external recording software.
:::

## What You Should See

After loading audio successfully, you should see:

- **Waveform display** showing amplitude over time
- **Time axis** at the bottom (0.0s, 0.5s, 1.0s, ...)
- **Filename** displayed in the interface
- **Spectrogram** (for files ≤60s) or "Zoom in for spectrogram" message

## Supported Audio Formats

Ozen-web supports most common audio formats via the Web Audio API:

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **WAV** | `.wav` |  Recommended, lossless, 16/24-bit PCM |
| **FLAC** | `.flac` | Compressed and lossless |
| **MP3** | `.mp3` |  Widely supported, lossy compression |
| **OGG** | `.ogg`, `.oga` | Open lossy compression format, good quality |

::: {.callout-tip}
For phonetic research, use **16-bit WAV files at 44.1kHz or 48kHz** sampling rate for best compatibility and quality.
:::

## File Size Limits

While there's no hard limit, practical constraints apply:

- **Small files** (< 1 MB, < 30s): Load instantly
- **Medium files** (1-10 MB, 30-300s): Load in 1-5 seconds
- **Large files** (> 10 MB, > 300s): May take 10+ seconds; spectrogram computed on-demand when zoomed

::: {.callout-note}
Files longer than 60 seconds show waveform immediately but require zooming to trigger spectrogram analysis. See [Features: Long Audio Handling](../features/overview.html#long-audio-handling) for details.
:::

## Loading a Different File

To load a new audio file:

1. Simply drag another file or click "Load Audio" again
2. The previous audio will be replaced (annotations are lost unless exported)

::: {.callout-warning}
Loading a new file clears all unsaved annotations and data points. Export your work first if needed (see [Section 6: Exporting](06-exporting.html)).
:::

## Troubleshooting

**File won't load:**

- Check the file format (use WAV if unsure)
- Ensure the file isn't corrupted (try playing in another app)
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages

**"Failed to decode audio" error:**

- File may be in an unsupported codec
- Convert to WAV using Audacity, FFmpeg, or Praat
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Edge have best codec support)

**Microphone doesn't work:**

- Check browser permissions (Settings → Privacy → Microphone)
- Ensure microphone is connected and working in other apps
- Try using HTTPS (microphone API requires secure context)

**File loads but no spectrogram:**

- For files >60s, zoom in to trigger analysis
- Check that WASM backend is loaded (see backend selector)
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R)

## Practice Exercise

Before moving to the next section, try:

1. Load an audio file using drag-and-drop
2. Load a different file using the file picker
3. Record 5 seconds of speech using the microphone
4. Observe the differences in waveform appearance

::: {.callout-try}
**Challenge:** Record yourself saying "hello" three times with different intonations (statement, question, excited). Notice how the pitch contours differ in the waveform.
