## Overview

This tutorial will guide you through the complete workflow of using
Ozen-web for acoustic analysis and annotation. By the end, you'll know
how to:

- Load and explore audio files
- View acoustic features (pitch, formants, intensity)
- Create and edit annotation tiers
- Collect acoustic measurements at specific points
- Export your annotations and data for analysis

**Prerequisites:**

- Ozen-web running ([Getting Started
  Guide](../getting-started.html)). The GitHub-hosted server should be
  enough for most purposes.
- A sample audio file (.wav, .flac, .mp3, or .ogg). You can also record yourself.
- Basic familiarity with spectrograms (helpful but not required)

## Sample Files

For this tutorial, you can use:

- **Your own audio**: Any .wav, .flac, .mp3, .ogg file of speech
- **Record in-browser**: Use the microphone icon to record a few sentences
- **Download samples**: [Example audio files](../examples/) from this documentation

::: {.callout-tip}
For your first time, use a short file (5-15 seconds) to see results quickly. You can try longer files later.

## Learning Path

**Complete beginner?** Follow sections 1-6 in order.

**Familiar with spectrograms?** Skip to section 3 (Acoustic Analysis) or 4 (Annotations).

**Just need annotation?** Jump to section 4 (Annotations) and 6 (Exporting).

**Just need measurements?** Go to sections 3 (Acoustic Analysis) and 5 (Data Collection).

## What You'll Create

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- ✅ An annotated audio file with multi-tier transcription
- ✅ A TextGrid file (Praat format) for further analysis
- ✅ A TSV file with acoustic measurements and labels
- ✅ Skills to analyze your own research audio

## Tips for Success

::: {.callout-tip}
**Use keyboard shortcuts** — They're listed in each section and dramatically speed up your workflow.
:::

::: {.callout-try}
**Experiment freely** — The app has undo/redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y), so you can't break anything.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
**Save your work** — Export your TextGrid and TSV files regularly (section 6) to avoid losing progress.
