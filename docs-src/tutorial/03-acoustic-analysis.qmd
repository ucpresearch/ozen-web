## Overview

ozen-web can display multiple acoustic features overlaid on the spectrogram:

- **Pitch (F0)** — Fundamental frequency (blue line and dots)
- **Formants (F1-F4)** — Resonance frequencies (red dots)
- **Intensity** — Loudness over time (green line)
- **HNR** — Voice quality (harmonicity)
- **CoG** — Spectral center of gravity
- **Spectral Tilt** — High/low frequency balance
- **A1-P0** — Nasal formant measure

In this section, you'll learn to enable these overlays and interpret what they show.

## The Overlay Controls

Look for the **overlay checkboxes** in the interface (usually in a sidebar or below the spectrogram).

![Overlay toggle controls](../screenshots/tutorial-03-overlay-checkboxes.png){.screenshot}

## Enabling Pitch

Pitch (fundamental frequency) is the most commonly used overlay.

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Check the "Pitch" checkbox**

2. Wait 1-2 seconds for computation (first time only)

3. A **blue line with dots** appears on the spectrogram

   ![Spectrogram with pitch overlay](../screenshots/tutorial-03-pitch-overlay.png){.screenshot}

4. Each dot represents one pitch measurement

5. Vertical position = frequency (Hz)
:::

### Interpreting the Pitch Overlay

- **Higher on screen** = higher pitch (e.g., 300 Hz for female voices)
- **Lower on screen** = lower pitch (e.g., 100 Hz for male voices)
- **Gaps in the line** = unvoiced sounds (s, f, t, k, etc.) or pitch detection failures
- **Smooth contours** = steady pitch (vowels)
- **Sharp movements** = pitch changes (intonation)

::: {.callout-try}
**Try this:** Record or load a sentence with a question. You'll see the pitch rise at the end.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Pitch is only detected in **voiced** segments. Consonants like [s], [f], [θ] won't show pitch values.
:::

## Enabling Formants

Formants show the resonance frequencies that distinguish vowels.

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Check the "Formants" checkbox**

2. **Red dots** appear on the spectrogram

   ![Spectrogram with formants overlay](../screenshots/tutorial-03-formant-overlay.png){.screenshot}

3. Four vertical series of dots represent F1 (lowest), F2, F3, F4 (highest)
:::

### Interpreting the Formant Overlay

Formants reveal vowel identity:

| Vowel | F1 (Hz) | F2 (Hz) | Appearance on Spectrogram |
|-------|---------|---------|---------------------------|
| [i] "see" | ~300 | ~2300 | F1 low, F2 very high |
| [u] "soon" | ~300 | ~800 | F1 low, F2 low |
| [a] "father" | ~700 | ~1200 | F1 high, F2 mid |
| [ɛ] "bed" | ~600 | ~1800 | F1 mid-high, F2 high |

::: {.callout-try}
**Try this:** Find a vowel in your audio, place the cursor in the middle, and read F1 and F2 values in the values panel. Compare to the table above.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
F1 roughly corresponds to **tongue height** (high = low F1, low = high F1).
F2 roughly corresponds to **tongue frontness** (front = high F2, back = low F2).
:::

## Enabling Intensity

Intensity shows loudness over time.

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Check the "Intensity" checkbox**

2. A **green line** appears, usually in the upper part of the spectrogram

   ![Spectrogram with intensity overlay](../screenshots/intensity-overlay.png){.screenshot}

3. Height corresponds to decibels (dB)
:::

### Interpreting Intensity

- **Higher** = louder segments (stressed syllables, vowels)
- **Lower** = quieter segments (unstressed syllables, consonants)
- **Drops to bottom** = silence

::: {.callout-try}
**Try this:** Say a sentence with strong stress on one word. The intensity overlay will peak on the stressed syllable.
:::

## Enabling Advanced Overlays

### HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio)

Measures voice quality:

- **High HNR** (>10 dB) = clear, modal voice
- **Low HNR** (<5 dB) = breathy or creaky voice
- **Very low HNR** = whisper or noise

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. Check the "HNR" checkbox
2. Orange/yellow line appears
3. Higher = more harmonic (less noisy)
:::

### CoG (Center of Gravity)

Measures spectral balance:

- **High CoG** (>5000 Hz) = sibilants (s, sh), fricatives
- **Low CoG** (<3000 Hz) = vowels, sonorants

Useful for distinguishing fricatives.

### Spectral Tilt

Measures high vs. low frequency emphasis:

- **Positive tilt** = more energy in low frequencies (vowels)
- **Negative tilt** = more energy in high frequencies (fricatives)

### A1-P0

A measure related to nasality and open quotient. Useful for advanced research.

::: {.callout-note}
Advanced overlays (HNR, CoG, Spectral Tilt, A1-P0) are primarily useful for specialized phonetic research. Most users only need Pitch, Formants, and Intensity.
:::

## Viewing All Overlays Together

You can enable multiple overlays simultaneously:

![All overlays enabled](../screenshots/tutorial-03-all-overlays.png){.screenshot}

::: {.callout-warning}
Enabling too many overlays at once can make the display cluttered. Start with Pitch + Formants for most tasks.
:::

## Reading Values at the Cursor

The **values panel** shows precise measurements at the cursor:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. Enable the overlays you're interested in (e.g., Pitch and Formants)

2. Place the cursor in a vowel

3. Read the values panel:
   - **Time:** 0.452 s
   - **Freq:** 1234 Hz (where you clicked)
   - **Pitch:** 234 Hz
   - **Intensity:** 68 dB
   - **F1:** 523 Hz
   - **F2:** 1987 Hz
   - **F3:** 2743 Hz
   - **F4:** 3543 Hz

   ![Values panel with measurements](../screenshots/tutorial-05-datapoint-values.png){.screenshot}
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
You can collect these measurements systematically using **data points** (covered in section 5).
:::

## Customizing Analysis Settings

You can adjust analysis parameters via the settings panel (if available) or `config.yaml`:

**Pitch settings:**

- `pitchFloor`: Minimum pitch to detect (default: 75 Hz)
- `pitchCeiling`: Maximum pitch to detect (default: 600 Hz)

**Formant settings:**

- `maxFormants`: Number of formants to track (default: 5)
- `maxFormantFrequency`: Analysis ceiling (default: 5500 Hz for female voices, 5000 Hz for males)

See [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.html) for all options.

## Changing Spectrogram Max Frequency

You may want to adjust the vertical range of the spectrogram:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. Find the **Max Frequency** dropdown (usually in toolbar)

2. Choose a ceiling:
   - **5 kHz** — Good for speech (default)
   - **7.5 kHz** — Includes higher formants
   - **10 kHz** — Full range, useful for fricatives

3. The spectrogram y-axis rescales
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
For most speech analysis, **5 kHz** is sufficient. Use 7.5-10 kHz if studying sibilants or children's voices.
:::

## Practice Exercises

1. **Enable Pitch only**
   - Find a vowel
   - Place cursor in the middle
   - Note the pitch value

2. **Enable Formants**
   - Identify F1 and F2 for the same vowel
   - Try to guess the vowel based on formants (use the table above)

3. **Enable Intensity**
   - Find the loudest part of your audio
   - Compare intensity values across different sounds

4. **Enable all overlays**
   - Observe how different overlays align
   - Notice which features co-vary (e.g., intensity and voicing)

::: {.callout-try}
**Challenge:** Record three vowels: [i], [a], [u]. Enable formants and verify that F1 and F2 values match the expected patterns from the table.
:::

## Troubleshooting

**Pitch overlay doesn't appear:**

- Ensure WASM backend is loaded (check backend selector)
- Try enabling/disabling the checkbox
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Pitch values seem wrong:**

- Adjust `pitchFloor` and `pitchCeiling` for your speaker
- Male voices: Try 50-300 Hz range
- Female voices: Try 100-500 Hz range
- Children: Try 150-600 Hz range

**Formants are missing or erratic:**

- Ensure you're looking at a vowel (not a consonant)
- Try adjusting `maxFormantFrequency` (5500 for females, 5000 for males)
- Zoom in to see individual formant dots more clearly

**Too many overlays, display is cluttered:**

- Disable overlays you're not actively using
- Use the values panel to read measurements instead of viewing all overlays

**Overlays don't update when zooming:**

- This is expected for files >60s — analysis recomputes when zoomed
- Wait 1-2 seconds after zooming for the update

## What's Next?
