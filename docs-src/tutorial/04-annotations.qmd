## Overview

Annotations let you add time-aligned transcriptions to your audio. In this section, you'll learn:

- Creating annotation tiers
- Adding and removing boundaries
- Editing interval labels
- Using keyboard shortcuts for efficient annotation
- Understanding tier types (interval and point)

## What Are Annotation Tiers?

**Annotation tiers** divide your audio into labeled intervals, similar to Praat's TextGrid format.

**Common uses:**

- **Phonetic transcription**: Mark phones/phonemes
- **Word alignment**: Segment words with timestamps
- **Prosody**: Label pitch accents and breaks
- **Events**: Mark breathing, laughter, noise

## Creating Your First Tier

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Click the "+ Add Tier" button** (usually below the spectrogram)

   ![Add tier button](../screenshots/tutorial-04-add-tier.png){.screenshot}

2. **Enter a tier name** in the dialog:
   - Examples: "phones", "words", "syllables"
   - Names should be descriptive and lowercase

3. **Press Enter or click OK**

4. A new tier appears below the spectrogram
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Create multiple tiers for different levels of analysis (e.g., "words" tier above "phones" tier).
:::

## Adding Boundaries

Boundaries divide a tier into intervals. Each interval can have a text label.

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Double-click on a tier** at the time position where you want a boundary

   ![Adding a boundary](../screenshots/tutorial-04-add-boundary.png){.screenshot}

2. A **vertical boundary line** appears

3. This creates two intervals: before and after the boundary

4. Repeat to add more boundaries
:::

**Keyboard shortcut:**

- **Double-click on tier** — Add boundary at that time position

::: {.callout-try}
**Try this:** Zoom in on a word and add boundaries at the start and end of each phone. You'll create a series of intervals corresponding to individual sounds.
:::

## Editing Interval Labels

Each interval can have a text label (e.g., a phone symbol, word, or comment).

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Double-click on an interval** (the space between two boundaries)

2. A **text input field** appears

   ![Editing an interval label](../screenshots/tutorial-04-edit-label.png){.screenshot}

3. **Type the label** (e.g., "a", "s", "hello", "breath")

4. **Press Enter** to save

5. **Press Escape** to cancel without saving
:::

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

- **Double-click interval** — Edit label
- **Enter** — Save label
- **Escape** — Cancel editing
- **Tab** — Move to next interval (if implemented)

::: {.callout-tip}
Use IPA symbols for phonetic transcription. Most browsers support Unicode IPA input. Install an IPA keyboard or use copy-paste from a character palette.
:::

## Moving Boundaries

You can adjust boundary positions by dragging:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Click on a boundary** line

2. **Drag left or right** to adjust its position

3. Release to finalize the position
:::

::: {.callout-note}
When you move a boundary, both adjacent intervals resize accordingly. The boundary to the left and right of the moved boundary stay fixed.
:::

## Removing Boundaries

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Right-click on a boundary** line

2. Select **"Remove boundary"** from the context menu

   ![Boundary context menu](../screenshots/tutorial-04-boundary-menu.png){.screenshot}

3. The boundary is deleted, merging the two adjacent intervals

4. The merged interval's label becomes the label of the left interval
:::

**Keyboard shortcut (if implemented):**

- **Select boundary + Delete key** — Remove selected boundary

::: {.callout-warning}
Removing a boundary merges intervals permanently (unless you undo). Use Ctrl+Z to undo if needed.
:::

## Undo and Redo

Ozen-web has unified undo/redo for all annotation actions:

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

- <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd+Z</kbd> (Mac) — Undo last action
- <kbd>Ctrl+Y</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Z</kbd> — Redo

**Undoable actions:**

- Adding boundaries
- Removing boundaries
- Moving boundaries
- Editing interval labels
- Adding/removing data points (section 5)

**Non-undoable actions** (by design):

- Adding/removing tiers
- Loading audio files
- Loading TextGrid files

::: {.callout-tip}
Get comfortable with Ctrl+Z! It allows you to experiment freely without worrying about mistakes.
:::

## Working with Multiple Tiers

Create hierarchical annotations with multiple tiers:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Add a "words" tier** (click "+ Add Tier")

2. **Add a "phones" tier**

3. In the words tier, add boundaries at word boundaries

4. In the phones tier, add boundaries at phone boundaries (within each word)

5. Label each interval appropriately
:::

### Tier Ordering

Tiers are displayed bottom-to-top in the order they were created. Some implementations allow reordering (check your version).

Convention: Place higher-level tiers (words, phrases) above lower-level tiers (phones).

## Boundary Snapping

Ozen-web supports **boundary snapping** to help align tiers:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. When adding a boundary on a lower tier, move your cursor close to an existing boundary on an upper tier

2. The cursor "snaps" to align with the upper tier's boundary

3. Double-click to place the boundary at the snapped position
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
This feature helps maintain consistent alignment across tiers (e.g., ensuring word boundaries align across "words" and "phones" tiers).
:::

## Selecting Annotation Tiers

Some operations require selecting which tier to work on:

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

- <kbd>1</kbd> — Select tier 1
- <kbd>2</kbd> — Select tier 2
- <kbd>3</kbd> — Select tier 3
- <kbd>4</kbd> — Select tier 4
- <kbd>5</kbd> — Select tier 5

The selected tier is highlighted or indicated visually.

## Example Workflow

Let's annotate a short phrase: "hello world"

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Load audio** (section 1) with someone saying "hello world"

2. **Add a "words" tier**

3. Zoom to see the full phrase

4. **Double-click** at the start of "hello" to add a boundary

5. **Double-click** between "hello" and "world" to add a boundary

6. **Double-click** at the end of "world" to add a boundary

7. Now you have three intervals:
   - Silence before "hello"
   - "hello"
   - "world"
   - Silence after (implicit, extends to end)

8. **Double-click the first interval** and type "hello", press Enter

9. **Double-click the second interval** and type "world", press Enter

10. **Add a "phones" tier**

11. Zoom in on "hello"

12. Add boundaries and labels for each phone:
    - /h/ [h]
    - /ɛ/ [ɛ]
    - /l/ [l]
    - /oʊ/ [oʊ] 

13. Repeat for "world":
    - /w/ [w]
    - /ɝ/ [ɝ] 
    - /l/ [l]
    - /d/ [d]

## Practice Exercises

1. **Create a "syllables" tier**
   - Mark syllable boundaries in a word
   - Label each syllable

2. **Create a "phones" tier**
   - Transcribe a short word phonetically
   - Use IPA symbols if possible

3. **Practice undo/redo**
   - Add several boundaries
   - Undo them all (Ctrl+Z repeatedly)
   - Redo (Ctrl+Y)

4. **Move boundaries**
   - Add a boundary slightly off
   - Drag it to the correct position
   - Use playback (Space) to verify alignment

::: {.callout-try}
**Challenge:** Annotate a complete sentence with two tiers:

1. **Words tier**: Segment into words
2. **Phones tier**: Transcribe each word phonetically

Use boundary snapping to align phone boundaries with word boundaries.
:::

## Troubleshooting

**Can't add boundary:**

- Ensure you're double-clicking on the tier, not on an interval or the spectrogram
- Check that the tier is selected (if your version requires selection)

**Boundary appears in wrong location:**

- Zoom in for more precise placement
- You can drag the boundary to adjust after placing

**Can't edit label:**

- Double-click the *interval* (space between boundaries), not the boundary line itself
- Ensure you're double-clicking, not single-clicking

**Undo doesn't work:**

- Check that you're using the correct keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Z, not Alt+Z)
- Ensure the app window has focus (click on it first)

**Tier names overlap:**

- Tier labels may overlap if many tiers are shown; this is a UI limitation
- Use short tier names ("W" for words, "P" for phones) if needed
