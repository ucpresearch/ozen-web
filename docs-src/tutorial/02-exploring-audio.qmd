## Overview

In this section, you'll learn essential navigation techniques:

- Placing the cursor
- Selecting audio regions
- Zooming in and out
- Panning the view
- Playing audio

## The Interface Layout

After loading audio, you'll see:

- **Waveform panel** (top) — Shows amplitude over time
- **Spectrogram panel** (middle) — Shows frequency content over time
- **Annotation tiers** (bottom) — For transcription (covered in section 4)
- **Time axis** — Shows time in seconds
- **Values panel** (right) — Shows acoustic measurements at cursor

## Placing the Cursor

The cursor is a vertical red line that shows the current time position.

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Click anywhere** on the waveform or spectrogram

2. The **red cursor line** appears at that time position

   ![Cursor placement](../screenshots/tutorial-02-cursor-placement.png){.screenshot}

3. The **values panel** updates to show acoustic measurements at the cursor time
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
**Keyboard shortcut:** Use **Left/Right arrow keys** to move the cursor in small increments (10ms steps).
:::

## Selecting Audio Regions

Select a time range to play or analyze a specific section:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Click and drag** across the waveform or spectrogram

2. A **blue highlighted region** shows your selection

   ![Selected region](../screenshots/tutorial-02-selection.png){.screenshot}

3. Release the mouse to finalize the selection

4. The selection remains until you click elsewhere or press Escape
:::

::: {.callout-try}
Try selecting a single word or syllable in your audio. The selection will be useful for playback (next section).
:::

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

- **Shift + Left/Right arrows** — Extend or shrink selection
- **Escape** — Clear selection

## Zooming

Zooming lets you see fine-grained detail in the audio.

### Zoom with Mouse Wheel

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Hover your mouse** over the spectrogram or waveform

2. **Scroll the mouse wheel**:
   - **Scroll up** → Zoom in (expands time scale)
   - **Scroll down** → Zoom out (compresses time scale)

3. Zoom is **centered on the mouse cursor position**

   ![Zoom demonstration](../screenshots/tutorial-02-zoom-demo.png){.screenshot}
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Zoom is centered on your mouse position, so place the mouse over the region you want to examine before scrolling.
:::

### Zoom Levels

You can zoom from:

- **Maximum zoom out**: Entire audio file visible (e.g., 0-300s)
- **Maximum zoom in**: Individual pitch periods visible (~20-50ms windows)

::: {.callout-note}
For files >60 seconds, the spectrogram only computes for the visible time window when zoomed. This prevents UI freezing on long recordings.
:::

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

- **+** / **-** keys — Zoom in/out centered on cursor
- **Mouse wheel** — Zoom centered on mouse position (recommended)

## Panning

Pan the view to explore different parts of the audio horizontally.

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Use horizontal scrollbar** at the bottom of the view

   OR

2. **Click and drag horizontally** while holding Ctrl/Cmd key

3. The visible time window shifts left or right
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
On trackpads, use **two-finger horizontal swipe** to pan smoothly.
:::

## Playing Audio

Play your audio or selected regions to hear what you're analyzing.

### Play Entire Visible Window

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. Press **Tab** key

2. Audio plays from the start to the end of the visible window

3. A **moving green playback cursor** shows the current position

4. Press **Escape** or **Space** to stop
:::

### Play Selected Region

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Select a region** (click and drag)

2. Press **Space** key

3. Only the selected audio plays

4. Press **Space** again to pause, or **Escape** to stop and deselect
:::

### Play from Cursor

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Click to place the cursor** at a time position

2. **Press Space**

3. Audio plays from cursor to the end of the visible window
:::

::: {.callout-try}
**Practice:** Select a single vowel in your audio and press Space repeatedly to hear it in isolation. This is useful for formant analysis.
:::

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Play selection (or from cursor if no selection) |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Play entire visible window |
| <kbd>Escape</kbd> | Stop playback and clear selection |

## Combining Navigation Techniques

Efficient workflow combines all these techniques:

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Zoom out** to see the full file (scroll wheel down)

2. **Click** on an interesting region (e.g., a word or phrase)

3. **Zoom in** on that region (scroll wheel up)

4. **Select** a portion (click and drag)

5. **Play the selection** (Space key)

6. **Place cursor** on a specific point (click)

7. **Read acoustic values** in the values panel
:::

## The Values Panel

The **values panel** (right side) shows acoustic measurements at the cursor position:

- **Time** — Current cursor position (seconds)
- **Frequency** — Frequency under mouse (Hz)
- **Pitch (F0)** — Fundamental frequency (Hz)
- **Intensity** — Sound pressure level (dB)
- **F1, F2, F3, F4** — Formant frequencies (Hz)
- **HNR** — Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (dB)
- **CoG** — Spectral center of gravity (Hz)
- **More** — Additional measurements

![Values panel showing measurements](../screenshots/tutorial-02-values-panel.png){.screenshot}

::: {.callout-note}
Values are only shown when acoustic overlays are enabled (covered in the next section). If you see "—" for all values, you need to enable overlays first.
:::

## Practice Exercises

Before moving to the next section, practice these skills:

1. **Zoom in** to see a single word clearly
2. **Select** that word and play it (Space)
3. **Place the cursor** in the middle of a vowel
4. **Zoom in further** to see individual pitch periods
5. **Pan left and right** to explore neighboring sounds
6. **Zoom out** to see the full audio again

::: {.callout-try}
**Challenge:** Find three vowels in your audio. For each one:

- Zoom to show just that vowel
- Place cursor in the middle
- Note the approximate pitch (you'll see this more clearly in the next section)
:::

## Troubleshooting

**Zoom isn't working:**

- Ensure mouse is over the waveform/spectrogram area
- Try using +/- keys instead of mouse wheel
- Check that your browser allows scroll events

**Playback doesn't work:**

- Check browser audio isn't muted
- Ensure audio output device is connected
- Try clicking the page first (browsers require user interaction for audio)

**Cursor jumps unexpectedly:**

- This happens if you click during playback
- Press Escape to stop playback first

**Spectrogram shows "Zoom in for spectrogram":**

- Your file is >60 seconds
- Zoom in to a window ≤60 seconds to trigger analysis
- This is normal behavior for long files

## What's Next?

Now that you can navigate the audio, let's enable acoustic overlays to see pitch, formants, and intensity.
