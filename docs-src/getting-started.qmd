## Overview

Ozen-web is a static web application that runs entirely in your browser. You can:

1. **Use the hosted version** (easiest) — No setup required
2. **Run locally for development** — Full control and offline access
3. **Deploy your own instance** — Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host

## Option 1: Use Hosted Version

The fastest way to get started is using the hosted version:

**🌐 [https://ucpresearch.github.io/ozen-web/live/](https://ucpresearch.github.io/ozen-web/live/index.html)**

Simply visit the URL and drag an audio file (WAV, FLAC, MP3, OGG) to begin analyzing.

::: {.callout-tip}
Bookmark the URL for quick access. All processing happens locally in your browser — no data is uploaded to servers.
:::

### Loading Your First Audio File

::: {.tutorial-steps}
1. **Drag and drop** a WAV, FLAC, MP3, or OGG file onto the interface

   OR

   **Click "Load Audio"** button and select a file

2. Wait for the waveform to appear

3. The spectrogram will load automatically (or zoom in for long files)

4. Enable acoustic overlays using checkboxes: Pitch, Formants, Intensity
:::

::: {.callout-try}
Don't have an audio file handy? Record directly in the browser by clicking the microphone icon 🎤 (requires microphone permission).

## Option 2: Run Locally

For development or offline use, run Ozen-web on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Any local web server, for instance `python -m http.server 8080`,
  started from one of the parent directories

### Download

- `git clone https://github.com/ucpresearch/ozen-web.git`

- `cd ozen-web/docs`

- `python -m http.server 8080` (adapt the port -- 8080 --  as necessary)

- Open the following url (adapt the port as necessary):
  (http://localhost:8080/live/index.html)[http://localhost:8080/live/index.html]  
  notice that this method doesn't use https, and your browser may
  complain about it

## Option 3: Deploy Your Own Instance

The `build/` or `docs/live` (same content) folder will work with any
static file host:

- **AWS S3** + CloudFront
- **Google Cloud Storage**
- **Azure Static Web Apps**
- **Cloudflare Pages**
- **GitLab Pages**

Just upload the `build/` folder's contents.

## Configuration

### Backend Selection

Ozen-web supports multiple WASM backends:

| Backend | Source | License | Offline |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| `praatfan-local` | `static/wasm/` | MIT/Apache-2.0 | ✅ Yes |
| `praatfan` | GitHub Pages CDN | MIT/Apache-2.0 | ❌ No |
| `praatfan-gpl` | GitHub Pages CDN | GPL | ❌ No |

Select the backend using the dropdown in the app interface.

See [WASM Backends Reference](reference/backends.html) for detailed comparison.

### Custom Configuration

Create `static/config.yaml` to customize default settings:

```yaml
# Example configuration
backend: "praatfan-local"
maxFrequency: 5000
showPitch: true
showFormants: true
theme: "dark"
```

See [Configuration Reference](reference/configuration.html) for all options.

## Troubleshooting

### WASM Fails to Load

- **Check backend selection**: Try switching between backends in the dropdown
- **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- **Check browser console**: Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab for error messages

### Audio File Won't Load

- **Supported formats**: WAV, FLAC, MP3, OGG (16-bit or 24-bit PCM for WAV)
- **File size**: Files >100MB may be slow; try shorter clips

### Long Audio Files Show "Zoom in for spectrogram"

This is expected behavior for files >60 seconds. Zoom in to a window ≤60s to trigger analysis.

See [Features: Long Audio Handling](features/overview.html#long-audio-handling) for details.
